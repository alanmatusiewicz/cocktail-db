  <p>
    Welcome to the Cocktail Database Project!
  </p>

  <p>
    This is an educational project to practice Ruby on Rails. In creating this app, I hope to address issues I have run into when selecting a cocktail recipe: finding a random cocktail recipe and finding only recipes that I have the ingredients for.
  </p>

  <p>
    The initial list of recipes in the app come from the International Bartenders Association's official list. Official recipes are marked with the ribbon icon shown below. To learn more about the Internation Bartenders Association (IBA), please visit their <a href="https://iba-world.com/" target="_blank">official website</a> The IBA publishes their official recipes using metric measurements. Official recipes have been converted directly to U.S. volume measurements. As a result, you will see some somewhat unusual decimal measurements on IBA official recipes in the app.
